# Godot Strata

Strata is a __*experimental* simple horizontal sidescrolling shooter with further roguelike elements__ to spice things up. This is my first game, so most of its contents are based on tutorials and the official Godot documentation, and I'll try to address every source in each section.

Strata's purpose is to have a great variety of mechanisms and extensively documented info directed for people wanting to learn the foundations of Godot. This game will also be uploaded in __[itch.io](http://itch.io)__ after completion, but this version will be always here *and open source*. There is no better way to learn than to teach.

The game should contain a hierarchy of simple scripts:

* Controllable 2D character
* Animated sprites
* Moving parallax background, including:
  * Dynamic speed and height
  * Centralized movement script
* Enemies behavior and collision
* Firstly a singular simple stage, then:
  * Both random and scripted events
  * Different scenarios
  * Difficulty and stage progression
* Modular components, such as:
  * Health
  * Hitbox
  * Projectile
  * Item
  * Stage
* Game state controller, with:
  * Pause
  * Main menu
  * Game over screen
  * Keybinding menu

After completion, this repository will also bear a *__.pdf__* file where each detail, issue, and solution should be registered. After gathering more experience both in Godot and overall game design, it is __highly__ probable that I'll redo some aspects of the game in another project, but I'll also surely document the differences and explain the reason behind them.
