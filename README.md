# Godot Strata

Prototype game in Godot 4.2+ made to test and learn firsthand how to make scripts, integrate modular composition and use various nodes. Its purpose is to have a great variety of mechanisms and commented info as to reinforce my knowledge in certain aspects and to serve as a foundation to people wanting to learn Godot as well! This game will also be uploaded in [itch.io](itch.io) after completion, but this version will be always here *and open source*.
