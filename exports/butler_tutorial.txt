Hi! This document is complementary to the butler usage tutorial on youtube.
If this is completely new to you, I highly suggest you to see the video on which I also talk about versioning and Git in general
Butler's official documentation is in: https://itch.io/docs/butler/
Everything here is based on that documentation, and applied to this project as an practical example!

| INSTALLING BUTLER |



| USING BUTLER |

You can run manual commands to push, for example:

	butler push exports/web nyeptun/strata-zero:web --userversion 0.4.8

* This will push from the web directory (make sure you're on root directory first) directly into itch.io, under 'web' channel and with version '0.4.8'
* This will not work if you didn't authenticate in and install butler binary, that is also takes part in CI/CD pipeline
